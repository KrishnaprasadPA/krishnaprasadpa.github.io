7:T4a3,I’m a backend-focused Software Engineer with over four years of experience building reliable, scalable software systems. My work spans backend architecture, distributed systems, real-time data processing, and full-stack product development. At Arizona State University, I contributed to a research project that brought AI-driven insights into a decision-support platform — integrating machine learning models into real-world backend workflows.Previously, I worked at Target Corporation, where I led the development of core backend services that powered large-scale order management. My efforts improved system performance and reliability, helping streamline millions of daily transactions. I enjoy designing systems that are both robust and efficient, and I’m especially interested in the intersection of backend engineering and applied AI — finding practical ways to bring intelligent features into production systems.I hold a Master’s in Computer Science from Arizona State University and a Bachelor’s from NIT Calicut. Outside of work, I’m passionate about systems design, cloud infrastructure, and building tools that make complex technology approachable and impactful.0:{"P":null,"b":"q4RcEYuRVgeAhOHO2qzoR","p":"","c":["",""],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/ad9591b25a12e874.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"className":"__variable_5cfdac __variable_9a8899 antialiased","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"absolute inset-0 fixed -z-50","children":[["$","$L2",null,{}],["$","$L3",null,{}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"relative z-10 flex-grow overflow-y-auto","children":["$","$L4",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L5",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":404}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],[]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]}]]}]}]]}],{"children":["__PAGE__",["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","main",null,{"className":"relative min-h-screen overflow-hidden text-white bg-transparent","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"name":"Krishnaprasad Aji","tagline":"Software Engineer | Distributed Systems","content":"$7"}],["$","$L8",null,{"experience":[{"role":"Senior Engineer / Engineer","company":"Target Corporation","location":"Bangalore, India","period":"July 2019 – July 2023","bullets":["Built order management systems using Java/Kotlin and PostgreSQL, reducing stuck orders by 60%.","Redesigned microservices with Kafka, improving throughput 4x;
